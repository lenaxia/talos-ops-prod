# Job to clean up completed pods from Intel Device Plugins Operator
# This removes old completed pods that accumulate from previous deployments
# and can confuse monitoring tools like k8sgpt
#
# This is a one-time cleanup job that can be run manually or scheduled as needed.
# After running this job, the completed pods will be deleted.
#
# To run manually:
# kubectl apply -f <this-file>
# kubectl wait --for=condition=complete --timeout=300s job/intel-device-plugins-cleanup-completed-pods -n kube-system
# kubectl delete job intel-device-plugins-cleanup-completed-pods -n kube-system
